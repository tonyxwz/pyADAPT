## Sampling and point estimation

A sample is a part of a population. Although the generation of a sampling involves randomness to the compuation, the values such as mean, median are determined once the sampling is complete. These are called point estimation. It gives an estimation, but not the reliability, i.e. how big is the mistake between the estimation and the really value.

## [Central limit theorem (CLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)

In some situations, when independent variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. The condition to this theorem is that the corelation between these variables are not to big and the 

## [Law of Large Numbers (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)

 According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.
